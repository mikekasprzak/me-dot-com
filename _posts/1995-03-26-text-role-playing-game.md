I need to dig out the floppy disks, but this was my first complete game (an RPG no less) written in QBasic. Inspired by Legend of the Red Dragon (which, funny story, I become friends with the author of many years later).

Was shared on local BBSs, but gosh, I can't actually remember what I named it. Ha!

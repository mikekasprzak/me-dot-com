Something I try to do is make a project during the last few days of a year.

Me, I never went beyond Commodore Basic in my programming as a kid, so I decided to dig and write something using 6502 Assembly and a little bit of C. To make things ever more interesting, I took art/designs I created as a kid, and used them as the basis of what I was making.

Ultimately I ran out of time, but I managed to get something working that ran on real hardware, and even played music.

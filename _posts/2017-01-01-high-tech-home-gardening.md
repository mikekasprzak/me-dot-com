description: My first serious hardware project, a small low power device that monitored
  the moisture of plants in my garden

Just because, I decided to play around with arduinos and sensors, see if I could monitor mositure levels, then build a small gizmo I could check.

It worked! But it only lasted a couple days, as the moisture in the soil coroaded my probes. Oops!

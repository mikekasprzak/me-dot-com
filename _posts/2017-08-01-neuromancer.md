This is an ongoing video project taking a look at a lesser known 80's video game I'm quite fond of.

More than a simple "Lets Play", I've been writing custom software, refurbishing hardware, and researching just for this video mini-series.

This series takes a look at both the Commodore 64 and Amiga versions of the game. For reasons, the C64 version is played on an emulator, but the Amiga version is played on a real refurbished Amiga 500.

The project came out of a narirated Let's Play I did of the game back in 2015. Those videos racked up several thousand views. Unfortunately, I never finished the series, and some episodes I forget to export were lost by Twitch.tv's purge algorithm. I think it's a really interesting game, and want to show others what I think is cool about it.

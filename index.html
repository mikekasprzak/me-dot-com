				Founded in 2002, Ludum Dare is the largest and longest running online Game Jam event in the world. The Ludum Dare challenges developers from around the world to make a game, from scratch, in a weekend. Many thousands of people accept that challenge every April, August, and December.<br />
				<br />
				Part of the team that established the event nearly 15 years ago, Mike has been its caretaker for the past 8 years. Organizing, hosting, administrating, fixing bugs, and supporting. If there's a job to be done, Mike probably did it.<br />

			<h1>Engineering</h2>
			Though not always credited as such, in many of my jobs, I've been the go-to guy for foundation and toolchain development. I'd get things started, wiring up and ocassoinally building the systems used by the rest of the team to build our projects (games).
			<h2>Game Engines</h2>
			I wrote a lot of them.
			<h2>Physics</h2>
			To make my game engines better, I taught myself physics.
			<h2>Quack</h2>
			Fancy as Fuuuu

			Later versions supported skeletal-animation and physics, but the project was shelved when I switched my focus to Ludum Dare.

			I write sometimes. I've done numerous interviews on behalf of Ludum Dare, some in pretty serious publications. I've also done a few podcasts. Blah blah.

			<h1>Fun Stuff</h2>
			Besides gaming, some other things I'm passionate about are Cooking and Electronics. I sometimes fiddle with music and art (cartooning, typography), but meh, lets focus the other two.
			<div>STFU Cooking - My cooking show, because why not have a cooking show? The format is a unique rapid-fire cooking show, design to cover a recipe from prep to result in about a minute.</div>
			<div>Digital Moisture Monitor mk1 - I have an herb garden, but I'm notoriously bad about remembering to water them. So I challenged myself to built a custom piece of hardware to monitor my plants, and let me know when they need water.</div>
